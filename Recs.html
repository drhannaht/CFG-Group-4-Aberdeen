                <p>On the surface, Sally Rooney‚Äôs ‚ÄòNormal People‚Äô is a classic will-they-won‚Äôt-they love story that follows Irish teenagers Marianne and Connell as they navigate identity, relationships, and growing up. However the novel also has a darker underbelly; exploring themes of domestic and physical abuse, depression, and co-dependency. The fluid story-telling feels like a friend updating you on their love life, each chapter a new instalment that starts a few months on from the previous one and fills in the gap in a non-linear fashion. Rooney‚Äôs secret is her ability to have the reader rooting for Connell and Marianne‚Äôs relationship, not because of the near-misses and inability to communicate their feelings (of which these moments were plentiful), but rather by building a relationship which is strong at the very foundation. Whether being on the peripherals of each other's lives, isolated by betrayal or toxic partners, or being by each other's sides, madly in love, the couple‚Äôs ability to understand one another is what makes this love story worth reading.

            <h3>The Great Gatsby</h3>

            <summary>
                <p> The Great Gatsby is simultaneously a romantic and cynical novel about the lives and unfulfillment of a group of wealthy New Yorkers during the roaring 20s. Fitzgerald paints a grim portrait of shallow characters who maneuver themselves into complex situations. The self-made Gatsby is relentless in pursuance of his dreams, an avant-garde prelude to the notion of the American Dream, hence his assigned ‚ÄòGreat‚Äô-ness. The Great Gatsby is in many ways similar to Romeo and Juliet, yet I believe that it is so much more than just a love story. Its the pursuit of the American Dream and the reflection on the hollowness of a life of leisure. The main message that Fitzgerald sends to us isn't that dreaming will lead to despair, but that chasing an unworthy dream will lead to tragedy. </p>

                <p> These are case studies of people who have lost their memories and with them the greater part of their pasts; who are no longer able to recognize people or common objects; whose limbs have become alien; who are afflicted and yet are gifted with uncanny artistic or mathematical talents. In Dr Sacks‚Äôs splendid and sympathetic telling, each tale is a unique and deeply human study of life struggling against incredible adversity.</p>

            <summary>
                <p>This is a great autobiography. It captures the excitment of starting a new business and the thrills of being novel in the approach. This is balanced by the struggles to maintain the business and a family life, especially caring for her autistic son. Stephanie writes honestly and shares her most personal thoughts. I learnt lots about entrepreneurship, philanthropy and work-life balance. A great read! </p>
